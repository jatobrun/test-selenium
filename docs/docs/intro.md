Thanks for the test was very interesting, i think can i implement more concepts like multithreading, 
elements in selenium with the getters and setters methods and i want to increase the performance of the second part.

I`m learning a lot with this test so i hope you enjoy.

PD: I want to implement the unit test with the module and make a github actions integrations for continuos integration but I do not have enough time, is weekend and my family want to pass time with theirs so apologize for that :).
